# Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

## Overview

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a form of public key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC allows for smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography (like RSA) while providing equivalent security. This results in faster computations, reduced storage requirements, and lower bandwidth usage.

## What is ECC?

Elliptic Curve Cryptography leverages the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to create secure cryptographic systems. An elliptic curve is a plane curve defined by an equation of the form:

\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \]

where `a` and `b` are constants. These curves are used over finite fields in cryptographic applications.

## Why Use ECC?

- **Security**: ECC provides high levels of security with smaller key sizes.
- **Efficiency**: Requires less computational power and memory compared to other algorithms like RSA.
- **Bandwidth**: Smaller key sizes result in reduced bandwidth for data transmission.

## Basic Concepts

### Elliptic Curves

An elliptic curve is defined by the equation:

\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \]

Points on this curve can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce other points on the curve.

### ECC Key Pair Generation

1. **Private Key**: A randomly selected integer `d` within the range `[1, n-1]`, where `n` is the order of the elliptic curve.
2. **Public Key**: A point `Q` on the elliptic curve, computed as \( Q = d \times G \), where `G` is the base point (a predefined point on the curve) and `d` is the private key.

### ECC Encryption and Decryption

- **Encryption**:
  1. Convert the plaintext message `M` into a point `P` on the elliptic curve.
  2. Select a random integer `k` within `[1, n-1]`.
  3. Compute `C1 = kG` and `C2 = P + kQ`, where `Q` is the recipient's public key.
  4. The ciphertext is the pair `(C1, C2)`.

- **Decryption**:
  1. Compute `P = C2 - dC1`, where `d` is the recipient's private key.
  2. Convert the point `P` back into the plaintext message `M`.

## Applications of ECC

- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is widely used for creating digital signatures.
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) is used for secure key exchange.
- **Encryption**: ECC algorithms are used in SSL/TLS protocols for secure web communications.
